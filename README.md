# UTwente- Introduction to Remote Sensing and Earth Observation Course guide
### This course was conducted by the faculty of ITC, University of Twente, The Netherlands. It's duration was from March 2021 to September 2021. I have taken assignments and final examinations, where I scored 6.99 out of 10. I have learnt the following topics of the course.

### Learning Objectives
At the end of this course, the students should be able to:
* Understand and apply knowledge about electromagnetic (EM) radiation processes in the atmosphere (absorption, transmission and scattering) and Earth's surface (reflection, absorption, transmission and emission) to extract land cover information.
* Translate geospatial questions into image characteristics and select the most suitable sensor data to extract information on the Earth's surface.
* Apply techniques for optimum visualisation of remotely sensed imagery.
* Choose and apply the appropriate geometric transformations of Earth Observation images to address specific spatial questions.
* Apply appropriate radiometric image correction and enhancement operations to improve image analysis.
* Apply pixel-based digital image classification to extract information on the Earth's surface.
* Work independently in solving a problem, by integrating knowledge on the topics previously covered in the course.
